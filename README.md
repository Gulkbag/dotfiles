# DOTFILES
These are my dot files, divided by directories for each program, i use I3WM and I3blocks for my i3bar, Suckless terminal, and neovim (My suckless terminal config is just vanilla with all the patches, and gruvbox theme), TMUX for making my life in the terminal easier and fish as my shell with the bobthefish theme
